# Demo Site

This site acts as a playground for experimeting with new development ideas - whether that be frontend or backend.

## Setup

### Frontend

- First, update node (using `nvm install`) to the correct node version - this can be found in `DemoSite/frontend/.nvmrc`
- Then, `cd` into `DemoSite/frontend` and run `npm install`
- Once this has completed, run the `npm run build` command from the same directory
